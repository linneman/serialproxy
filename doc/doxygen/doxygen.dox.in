 * @section serialproxy About serialproxy
 *
 * UART  interfaces are  still widely  used in  embedded system  applications today
 * e.g.  with  respect  to  automotive  applications in  order  to  interconnect  a
 * Linux  based embedded  CPU with  an CAN  Microcontroller. On  contrast to  Linux
 * pipes  UART's  provide  a  bidirectional  communication.  As  a  consequence  an
 * existing implementation which uses the  posix serial API cannot be transparently
 * used  with  named  pipes  in  Linux  nor   can  it  make  use  of  socket  based
 * communication  without changing  the  exting implemenation.  The present  sample
 * application  illustrates how  to overcome  this problem  using [pseudo  terminal
 * devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoterminal).  This allows  in example
 * to  transparently exchange  a  low level  transport layer  between  CAN and  CPU
 * without  affecting an  application on  top of  it. The  implementation has  been
 * inspired by  the article  [Using pseudo-terminals  (pty) to  control interactive
 * programs](http://rachid.koucha.free.fr/tech_corner/pty_pdip.html).
